# Kotlin Multiplatform Weather App (Work in Progress)

## Overview

This project is a work in progress and serves as a demonstration of Kotlin Multiplatform
capabilities for developing a weather application. The goal is to create a simple cross-platform app
that shows the weather of a specified location by implementing API calls.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows Kotlin Multiplatform conventions and is organized into common,
Android, and iOS source sets. Shared code is placed in the `commonMain` source set, and
platform-specific code is located in `androidMain` and `iosMain`.

## Features

- Cross-platform development with Kotlin Multiplatform.
- API calls to retrieve weather information.
- Common code for shared functionality.
- Platform-specific implementations for Android and iOS.
